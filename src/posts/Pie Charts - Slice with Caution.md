### Introduction

<br>

Briefly explain what a pie chart is, when it's typically used (i.e., to display categorical data), and why it's a popular choice.
However, mention that while they may seem straightforward, pie charts can sometimes create more confusion than clarity.

<br>

### The Problem With Pie Charts

<br>

Discuss how our eyes aren't good at comparing the size of angles or areas (which is what pie charts require us to do).
Explain the common pitfall of comparing two 'slices' that are of similar size. The slight differences can be hard to distinguish, leading to inaccurate interpretations of the data.
Show an example of a pie chart where two or more slices are nearly the same size, and explain how it can be misleading.

<br>

### How to Use Pie Charts Effectively

<br>

Suggest using pie charts only when the number of categories is small (usually 5 or less) to avoid overcomplicating the chart.
Emphasize that pie charts are most effective when one category dominates the others or when they're used to show proportional or percentage relationships.
Advise that the use of 3D pie charts should be avoided as they distort perception even more.
Encourage the use of labeling each slice with the corresponding percentage or data value for clarity.

<br>

### Alternatives to Pie Charts

<br>

Discuss other visual representations like bar graphs, line charts, or stacked bar charts, which often give a clearer picture of the data.
Specifically discuss the advantages of bar charts for comparing multiple categories: they use length (which our eyes are good at judging) rather than area or angle, and they can easily display a larger number of categories.
Show an example of how the data from your misleading pie chart would look in a bar graph, and explain why it's clearer.

<br>

### Pie Charts in Dashboard Design

<br>

Point out that in a dashboard, space is often limited. Since pie charts require more space to display the same amount of information as a bar or line chart, they might not be the best choice.
Highlight the concept of "data-ink ratio" introduced by Edward Tufte. Using pie charts, especially ones with many different categories, often results in a low data-ink ratio.
Suggest using pie charts in dashboards only when they are the most efficient and effective way to communicate the data story. Use examples to illustrate your points.

<br>

### Conclusion

<br>

Reiterate that while pie charts can be an effective tool for displaying certain types of data, it's crucial to be aware of their limitations.
Encourage readers to always consider their audience and the story they want to tell with their data before deciding on a visual representation.
